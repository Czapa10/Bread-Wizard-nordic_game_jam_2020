# Bread Wizard
The Game was made for Nordic Game Jam 2020 in 48 hours. (actually I worked on this game something about 12h)
It's a sokoban like puzzle game in which you have to fill all the furnaces with bread.

# Code
It's written in highly Data Oriented Style. It's mostly C but I use a few C++ features.
I used unity build (I compile only main.cpp and I include other .cpp files into main.cpp)
Renderer works at top of OpenGL.
